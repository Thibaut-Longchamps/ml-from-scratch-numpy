# ml-from-scratch-numpy
Machine Learning algorithms from scratch with NumPy. Step-by-step notebooks cover gradient descent, cost functions, regularization, encoding, normalization, metrics, train/test split, outlier handling. Current models: linear &amp; logistic regression. Focus on maths + code, not shortcuts â€” see under the hood of ML. More models soon.
